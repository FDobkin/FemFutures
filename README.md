# FemFutures
FemFutures is developing a wiki page that tracks changes in the social status of women over time. This repository will be used for data manipulation &amp; cleaning, analysis, and visualization. Everything in this file is coded in ggplot2. The repository includes both the code and .jpegs of the visualizations.
